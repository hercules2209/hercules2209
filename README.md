## Hey there! üëã

I'm Harshaditya, an aspiring AI/ML engineer/ Backend engineer on a quest to unlock the secrets of artificial intelligence and learn backend development. Currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI/ML at Vellore Institute of Technology, I'm diving deep into the realms of neural networks, decision trees, supervised/unsupervised learning, and cutting-edge technologies like CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, and Transformers and learning about micro-Service architectures, learning cloud services like GCP, AWS.
